                    <p>
                        If you are on Canada’s <a href="https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=reg/etr&document=index&lang=e">International Register of Electors</a>,
                        you should have already heard from Elections Canada.<sup>(I got an email on September 13.)</sup>
                        If you’re not on the register, here’s what you need to do:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Be a Canadian citizen.</li>
                        <li>Be at least 18 on October 21, 2019.</li>
                        <li>Look up the address of the last place you lived in Canada.<sup>(Maybe you still have your old postal code memorized, in which case I am impressed and you can skip this step.)</sup></li>
                        <li>Take a picture of your passport (page 2-3), citizenship card, or birth certificate.</li>
                        <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=svr&dir=app&document=page-f&lang=e">Canadian voter residing abroad</a> page on the Elections Canada website.</li>
                        <li>Fill in <a href="https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=svr&dir=app&document=page-h2&lang=e">the online application</a> by 6:00pm on October 15, 2019.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If you follow these steps, Canada will mail you a voting kit. You have to mail your ballot
                        <em>back</em> to Canada with enough time for it to arrive in Ottawa by 6:00pm EST on election
                        day.

                        <h3>I’ve been living outside of Canada for years</h3>
                        <p>
                            Good news: if you are a Canadian citizen, you can vote this October.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-expats-cant-vote-1.3204664">a whole kerfuffle</a>
                            about losing the right to vote if you’d been out of Canada for more than five years. This
                            January, the Supreme Court ruled that, nah, Canadian citizens get to vote in federal elections
                            no matter where they live.<sup>(If you are a nerd like me, you can read the <a href="https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/cb/2019/36645-eng.aspx"><em>Frank v. Canada</em> case brief</a> on the Supreme Court’s website.)</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This isn’t necessarily true for provincial elections! For example, I’m from Ontario and I’ve
                            been living outside of Canada since 2016, so I’m past the
                            <a href="https://www.elections.on.ca/en/voting-in-ontario/voter-registration/register-of-absentee-electors.html">two-year limit</a>
                            for being an “absentee voter”.

                        <p>
                            Okay, I will readily admit that our parliament is a bit less lively than ruckus down south.
                            However! This doesn’t mean the parties are all the same!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are meaningful differences between the parties! Are we going to keep the carbon tax? Are
                            we going to build more pipelines? Where? Are we going to accept more immigrants or “build a
                            fence”? Are we going to allow people to be banned from public employment because of their
                            religion? (Seriously, <a href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/andrew-coyne-federal-leaders-have-capitulated-on-quebecs-bill-21-and-to-our-shame-we-let-them">wtf</a>.)
                            I put links to some tools for contrasting party platforms <a href="#platform-contrasts">below</a>.

                            Sure, okay, there’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting">the paradox of voting</a>,
                            where it’s mildly inconvenient to vote and one marginal vote is unlikely to swing an election.
                            On the other hand, the riding where I used to live (and therefore where I'm voting this year)
                            swung from being handily won in 2006 <sup>by more than 12,000 votes!</sup> to being decided by
                            a <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/election-2011-a-riding-where-every-vote-counts"><em>17 vote margin</em></a>
                            in 2008.

                        <p>
                            Obviously, everyone votes for their own reasons. I mostly vote out of a sense of civic duty
                            and/or guilt. <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/election-2011-a-riding-where-every-vote-counts">
